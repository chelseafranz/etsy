"title": "You&#39;ll Be My Glass of Wine, I&#39;ll Be Your Shot of Whiskey, Honey Bee Antique Dictionary Pages Set of Two Art Print Wall Decor Valentine&#39;s Day",
"description": "115 year old antique dictionary pages printed with the lyrics from the song &quot;Honey Bee&quot; - &quot;You&#39;ll Be My Glass of Wine, I&#39;ll Be Your Shot of Whiskey&quot; set of two prints. If you&#39;re interested in the companion set of four prints shown in photo # 3 they can be found here: http://etsy.me/1axHnIV\r\n\r\nSee the rest of my shop here: http://www.etsy.com/shop/reimaginationprints\r\n\r\nThese antique dictionary pages are from an 1897 dictionary of the English language. The actual printed pages you will receive will be selected from the same set of antique dictionaries. Keep in mind that these dictionary pages are over 115 years old so there will be vartiations in the patina from page to page along with other minor and charming imperfections.\r\n\r\nPage size approximately 8x11 (20.32 cm x 27.94 cm). I especially like to work with this particular antique dictionary because the page size is so versatile. Very easy to frame! Perfect for an 8x10 or 8.5 x11 frame or 10x13 or 11x14 Frame with 8x10 mat opening. The top and bottom of the page have generous margins so of course you can trim or mat it to fit any size frame you like. \r\n\r\nFrame not included, you receive just the two prints.\r\n\r\n******* This listing may not be used as the free item in the Buy 2 Get 1 Free special. *******\r\n\r\n*** Frame not included. ***",

The rim is painted gold and the beaker has a cork bottom which would have protected it on a damp bar. The bottom also has a paper label with the importer&#39;s information and the beaker was designed by Quality Associates Inc. N.Y.,  N.Y. This was probably a giveaway from distributors to bar owners and liquor store owners. \r\n\r\nMeasures 4 1/4 inches tall, 3 inches across. \r\n\r\nIn good condition with wear to gold rim and cork bottom (please view photos 3 and 4 for detail). \r\n\r\nMore vintage barware at greenandbrown.etsy.com",

Buyer is responsible for procuring any refund directly from the USPS.  Returns may or may not be accepted for items arriving late, please see below for returns policy.",
"policy_refunds": "To maintain quality, all non-clothing items are not returnable and are sold as is, all sales final.  The following items are NOT RETURNABLE:\r\n\r\n-Housewares;\r\n-Jewelry;\r\n-Furs;\r\n-NOS/NWT New with Tags items with original tags or packaging missing, altered or removed;\r\n-All international orders;\r\n-Orders made using coupon codes or discounts.\r\n\r\nClothing items and shoes shipped domestically are returnable unless otherwise indicated.  In general, any clothing item(s) may be returned in its original condition within 7 days of confirmed delivery date for a full refund of the purchase price less a $10 processing fee per returned order.  Buyer pays return shipping via USPS Priority Mail including tracking and insurance and MUST message me and have the package postmarked, and send me the tracking number, within 7 calendar days of confirmed delivery date to receive a refund.  Funds will be promptly returned after the item(s) have been inspected.  This means buyer (you) pays shipping both ways plus a $10 processing fee.\r\n\r\nIf you feel I have grossly misrepresented a non-returnable item and you are not happy with it, please message me!\r\n\r\nLOST OR DAMAGED PACKAGES:  I have your back!  All items are insured through the USPS or a 3rd party carrier, or are self-insured by me.  I carefully and competently package all items, however...if your package arrives damaged, or if it has not arrived at all after 30 days, please message me right away to assist in the insurance claims process.  Please be aware that time limitations for insurance claims do apply, so do not hesitate!  After the claim has been timely completed and submitted, I will refund you directly for the purchase price plus original shipping.  Damaged items require close up and wide angle photographs of the outside of the package, the inside packing materials, the damaged item and the address label.  Lost item claims may require a notarized affidavit and/or federal mail theft charge to be filed.",
"policy_additional": "All items are stored in my smoke-free home and are delivered to you in their quality, found condition.  I do not generally clean or launder and leave this up to the new owner to clean or freshen as needed.  If you desire to clean your items upon receipt, please use care and research proper cleaning methods to preserve condition and avoid damage.\r\n\r\nVery minor &quot;flaws&quot; including as-manufactured flaws are to be expected in quality vintage items and may not be described in the listing; however, if I notice something unusual on inspection I will do my best to describe it accurately.  Where applicable, elastics are gently hand-stretched by me to make sure they have not lost their snap -- badly &quot;ruffled&quot; and dead elastics are not offered for sale.  Items with chips, stains, tears, missing or damaged pieces or other major flaws that interfere with the function or appeal of the piece are not offered for sale.  If you are unhappy with any clothing item or shoes for any reason, including an actual or perceived flaw, please feel free to return it in accordance with my returns policy.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: I measure in inches from seam to seam, laid flat, unstretched, on the outside of the garment.  Collar means collar seam, shoulder means shoulder seam etc.\r\n\r\nReservations: Accepted October 1 though December 7 only.  I am happy to reserve any item for you upon receipt of a 30% nonrefundable deposit, just ask!  Full deposit amount will be credited toward your purchase so long as you complete the transaction within 7 days of the reservation date.  After 7 days the item will be relisted and you will lose your deposit.  PayPal is the only method of payment available for reserved orders.  This policy is necessary and not negotiable.\r\n\r\nA note on vintage lingerie.  It is not recommended that these items be dry-cleaned or washed in Woolite.  Liquid Ivory dish soap is a gentle alternative and is made to not strip moisture from your hands; it seems not to strip or dry-out your quality vintage lingerie either, leaving it supple and velvety instead.  You will love it!\r\n\r\nA note on vintage jewelry.  Vintage rhinestones including foil backed rhinestones are very delicate and must be cleaned with extreme care, preferably a dry method so as to not damage the foil backings.  In general, metal jewelry as well as glassware and various household items are best cleaned with distilled water and a bit of white vinegar on a soft brush or cloth and then gently patted dry.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer and legal statement: all items are offered  for sale in their found, secondhand condition and no warranties exist, express or implied, including warranty of merchantability and warranty for a particular purpose.  All items are offered as collectors&#39; items for adults only.  Buyers&#39; sole remedy against seller is the return policy as outlined above.  Buyers must be 18 years of age or older.

"title": "A True Original – Honey Jack inspired water bottle labels - DIGITAL file only",
"description": "These water bottle labels were inspired by Honey Jack. They are a great addition to a milestone birthday! We will send you a digital file and you simply print and adhere them to your water bottle labels. \r\n\r\nSupplies you need: \r\nPaper\r\nPrinter\r\nRuler and X-acto knife OR scissors\r\nTape\r\n\r\n1. Once you download the file, print out as many labels as you need on paper then trim. Each label is approximately 10.46&quot; wide x 1&quot; high. It&#39;s easiest to use a ruler and X-acto knife and trim along the edges. Trim off excess paper off the ends, if needed. \r\n\r\n2. Simply remove the paper labels from your water bottles and wrap the personalized label around it. Tape into place. Careful not to put these directly into ice as the labels will be ruined. \r\n\r\nNote: this is a digital file only and you will receive a PDF file to print from. Nothing will be mailed to you. \r\n\r\nTo customize, please send us a message. It will take 48 hours to personalize your purchase and email the final file to you. You will need Adobe Acrobat to open and print any file. Note that work cannot begin on personalization until all information is received and item is paid in full. \r\n\r\nAny product names referenced on this shop are trademarked and property of the trademark owner.",

"policy_welcome": "Thank you for visiting my shop. I hope you have found something that catches your eye. All my jewelry is handmade by me, with semi-precious gemstones, with a variety of sterling silver accents and components. \r\n\r\nCare and Maintenance: \r\nSterling silver is the primary metal in most of my pieces.  Sterling will need an occasional polish from wear and natural oxidation.  Polishing cloths can be found in many stores, and I highly recommend them, instead of the &quot;dunk and soak&quot; solutions.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nMost of my earrings run from about 1.2&quot; to 2.5&quot; in size - I specify the exact size in each listing description - I measure the total length of the earring including the wire - basically the size is &quot;from your ear hole&quot;.  \r\n\r\nNecklaces please select your choice. 18&quot; is the average length, but it&#39;s up to you.   \r\n\r\nShopping With Me:\r\nLike most sellers, I also shop and browse on Etsy, and probably a lot of the other places you do too - so I adopt a &quot;treat as you&#39;d like to be treated&quot; philosophy. I realize there are thousands of other items and sellers, and ultimately want you to feel glad you chose to click on my jewelry. \r\n\r\nLost an Earring?\r\nI provide plastic Clutch stoppers to help you keep them on your ears, but if needed, can often provide a replacement for single lost earrings for half the cost of the original pair plus shipping. This of course depends on my still having the same stones/components, and I can&#39;t promise an EXACT match but I will work with you if needed. Please contact me for a custom listing if you need a replacement and I&#39;ll see what I can do. \r\n\r\n(^.^);",
"policy_payment": "I accept Etsy Direct/Credit Card Checkout, Etsy Gift Cards, or Paypal. All are easy, secure, simple. If you haven&#39;t used either before, Etsy&#39;s check out process will walk you through it. They can link to your credit card (all majors) or bank directly - your choice. \r\nFor items shipped to Florida addresses I am required to collect our state sales tax which goes from me directly to the Dept. Of Revenue. ",
"policy_shipping": "I ship all orders within 1-2 business days after your purchase. I ship via USPS First class, unless otherwise noted or arranged in advance, with actual transit time averaging 3-5 days domestically. \r\n\r\nPlease contact me before confirming your order if you need any special handling so we can be on the same page. Please contact me for a quote for Express or Priority upgrades - prior to purchase if possible, and include your zip code in the message.\r\n\r\nIf I am sending a gift on your behalf to the recipient, please let me know - would you like me to include a short note from you? No problem. \r\n\r\nIf paying by Paypal, your Paypal address should be the one I&#39;m expecting to ship to. I will contact you to discuss if needed, prior to shipping.\r\n\r\nI ship with Delivery Confirmation on all U.S. domestic packages. Orders over $250 will ship require signed deliveries for our mutual protection. International orders now track to Canada, most of the EU, Australia, NZ, and a few other countries.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL Buyers: I will use USPS First class shipping - delivery time varies based on country (2-4 weeks or more). I can upgrade if requested as with domestic, see above.  If your country is not listed as available in the listing, please contact me and perhaps we can make arrangements.\r\n\r\nSpecial Note: Duties and customs that your country requires must be the responsibility of the buyer. Please contact your local customs organization for more information. Please also be aware of your country restrictions specific to jewelry, silver, and gemstones - these laws often change by country. ",
"policy_refunds": "We both want you to be delighted with your purchase. If something isn&#39;t going to work for you, please contact me (convo/email) within 7 days of receipt, so we can mutually agree on either an exchange or return. \r\n\r\nAny refunds we agree to will of course first require a timely, safe return of the unworn items.",
"policy_additional": "Packaging - Your purchases will be individually wrapped in small cardboard jewelry boxes, suitable for gift giving, but performing the double duty of squish-proofing, to ensure their safe arrival, and travel in a protective bubble mailer. Please check my &quot;About&quot; page from the shop main links to see a sample of my packaging.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re interested in a modification of one of my existing designs, please contact me and hopefully we&#39;ll work something out! I&#39;m a daytime/US EST person so will try to reply anytime from 9am - 9pm EST (GMT-5) most days, give or take. Please allow sufficient time for custom orders as I may need to procure supplies for your request. \r\n\r\nWholesale inquiries welcome.\r\n\r\n*Policies: Updated Aug 2013: Shortened/rearranged wording, updated new country tracking info*",

"policy_shipping": "WHEN WILL PRINTS SHIP?\r\nALL prints are shipped using USPS First Class Mail within 1-3 days of receiving your order UNLESS otherwise specified in the listing or shop announcement. Please check this before ordering.\r\n\r\nHOW ARE PRINTS PACKAGED?\r\n8x10 prints - Are packaged in protective cellophane sleeves flat in a 100% recycled rigid mailer. \r\n11x14 prints - Are packaged the same way along with a double thick backing board.\r\n\r\n--- PLEASE KINDLY RECYCLE! ---\r\n\r\nWHERE ARE THEY SHIPPED?\r\nPrints are shipped right to you unless otherwise specified. Please let me know if a print(s) is(are) being sent as a gift! Please be aware that if large prints (11x14s) cannot be left in a mailbox, USPS may leave a slip in its place and you will have to get your order from the post office. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES/DOMESTIC ORDERS - Once shipped you will receive an email notifying you along with tracking information. Usually prints take 2-5 business days to arrive. If things take longer I apologize, once things leave my hands they are out of my control.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS - Once shipped you will receive an email notifying you along with customs number. Orders can take anywhere from 1-3 weeks to arrive once shipped. You are responsible for any duties, customs, and taxes levied by your country. Please check with your Customs office and/or Postal Service if you are concerned about possible taxes. \r\n\r\nTRACKING\r\nIncluded on all US orders - you will receive a tracking number when you receive your email confirming your print has been shipped. International orders have delivery confirmation.\r\n\r\nGIFTS\r\nIf your order is a gift for someone please make note of it in the message to seller box at checkout or contact me to let me know. I do not include receipts in ANY packages unless otherwise specified. Please let me know if you would like a gift receipt or a short hand written message included.\r\n\r\nLOST ORDERS\r\nWhile extremely rare, if a package ends up missing along it&#39;s travels to you, I am happy to send a replacement! Because mail can be delayed for a variety of reasons, I will wait 3 weeks from the original ship date of the first package for US orders, and 5 weeks for International orders before sending a replacement. Please let me know if you do not receive your package in that amount of time, otherwise I will assume you received your print(s).\r\n\r\nDAMAGED PRINTS\r\nI ship using rigid mailers to make sure that prints do not bend in transit. All envelops are also marked DO NOT BEND, however sometimes on rare occasions the post office or mail carrier can get a little rough. PLEASE let me know RIGHT AWAY when you get your print if it bent or damaged. I will have no idea otherwise and will assume all is well if I do not hear otherwise :)\r\n\r\nAny other problems please contact me via Etsy convo or email eatsaylove@gmail.com",

I offer replacement prints for those lost in the mail or damaged upon arrival. \r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you have ANY problems with your order. ",

"description": "Aged Bourbon :: Kentucky Single Barrel\r\n\r\nThose who have travelled with the Scodioli troupe know that running this outfit is no small task. Madame hustles her bustle from sunrise to sunset, and once those gates close for the night, she&#39;s more than ready to slip into that old clawfoot bath and sip a little whiskey. And this is no coffin varnish, mind you - Madame is terribly particular. Fine old whiskey ranks high on her list of favorites (just below chocolate and shoes, in fact). Although she shares her best bottle with precious few people, she doesn&#39;t see the harm in sharing the bouquet with you, dear reader.\r\n\r\nMadame has based this alluring scent on her favorite single barrel bourbon: delicate floral notes on top of richly aged wood and warm vanilla, earthy spice and the slightest hint of cherry and caramel. Cheers, darlings.\r\n\r\n30 ml\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis item is available for ground shipping only (USPS first class), and cannot be shipped outside of the US.\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\nATOMIZER BULB:\r\nShown in last photo. If you prefer this style, simply select the option in the dropdown box, and you will receive both the regular spray top with cap AND an atomizer bulb.\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\nFancy a little gift bag for your spray?

(Fragrance will return to it&#39;s solid state once cooled.)\r\n\r\nHow To Use Solid Perfumes:\r\nSimply rub your finger over the surface of the perfume, and then apply to any area of the body, preferably pulse points (your body heat will strengthen the scent). Solid perfumes are for external use only. DO NOT use as lip balm, or on sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nAllergies:\r\nRead all ingredients carefully before ordering, please - especially if you have known allergies to certain fragrances. Please contact the Madame if you have any questions or concerns. She is generally very quick at replying.\r\n\r\nWholesale:\r\nMost items are available for wholesale, and custom orders are welcome. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask! However, we will not do consignment and we will not ship our products to you without labels. It&#39;s the beard or nothing, baby.\r\nIf you are inquiring about a wholesale order, please provide the following info:\r\n– Your shop name and physical location.\r\n– Website if possible, or any social media links to your business.\r\n– Images of your shop (this is very important, as we want to ensure that we will be a good fit in your space).\r\n– A list of the products you are interested in carrying.\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nPlease note that packages can be delayed in customs for a number of reasons, and on rare occasion you may have to pay an additional fee to claim your package. We apologize that we have no control over this situation. Also please know your country&#39;s guidelines and restrictions for international packages. The most typical reason for packages held in customs is that an item contained within is prohibited by that country.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\nWe are perfectionists and we are pleasers. We receive very little negative feedback, and of course we&#39;d like to keep it that way! We understand that you may not like the scent you ordered – everyone&#39;s nose experiences scents differently. Before leaving any harsh feedback, please do consider other aspects of your experience here. We are quite proud of our customer service and speedy shipping. We work hard to deliver a positive experience with every order. xo",
