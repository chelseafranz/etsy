Please allow 2-5 days for USPS First Class mail transit time and 2-4 weeks for International destinations. If there is an unexpected delay of some sort, we will be sure to let you know.\r\n\r\n***If you have an e-Check pending, your order may be delayed up to a week until the payment posts. Also, if you have requested your order to be trimmed or cut out, this may also delay your estimated shipping date.\r\n\r\nAlthough we make every effort to make sure your purchase gets out right away, occassionally, there is a delay in receiving your item through USPS which is beyond our control.

I can promise that I will get your order out in a timely fashion and am always happy to help accommodate custom felt colors and thread colors to meet your needs.

"description": "Offered here is a Day of the Dead sugar skull horse.  She started out as a donkey, but now I think she more resembles a horse!  She is made with polymer clay, then painted with acrylics.   She&#39;s black, decorated with COLORFUL flowers and leaves.  She has a little pink glitter in her eyes and a WILD tail and mane of orange and pink faux fur.  She&#39;s signed and dated and measures about 6&quot; long and 5 3/4&quot; tall.\r\n\r\nThis piece is made with a lot of love and attention to detail. I also welcome custom orders for cake toppers, or any other Day of the Dead themed projects. To see more samples of my work, visit my flickr page at: http://www.flickr.com/photos/claylindo/.

I purchase these hand carved pendants from skilled artisans and then I hand paint them myself with acrylic enamel paints.  A protective layer is applied but as they are hand painted, care should be taken with them as not to scratch or chip them by putting them with keys or other sharp objects.

"description": "Personalized Child&#39;s Birth Plate -Baby Gift New Baby - Lamb or Sheep Design\r\n\r\nCHILDREN’S PLATES \r\nNow in my 35th year of making Cornish Hill Pottery, I am in the amazing position of going into a 2nd generation of Baby Plates! While usually ordered for a new baby, I have made these for bar/bat mitvahs, weddings, reunions, and graduations.\r\n\r\nThese 7” plates started out with one design... blue bunny on stoneware. Now there are three  “most popular” designs: \r\nbunny (still #1) \r\nteddy bear, and \r\nrocking horse. \r\n\r\nIn addition I make a\r\nlamb, \r\nkitty, \r\npuppy, \r\nsailboat,\r\n flowers, \r\nand a few other special requests. \r\nGenerally I can fit the entire child’s name and spell out the Month of the birthdate.\r\n\r\nEach plate is hand thrown and then decorated free hand with blue clay slip.  \r\nEach as unique as the child it is being made for.\r\n\r\n Personalized Items are always made to order \r\nIt usually takes between 4-6 weeks to complete an order.\r\n\r\nPlease enter the details of your plate in the message to seller window when you check out, including:\r\nnames: \r\ndate of birth:\r\nand design:\r\n\r\nThe plate will be delivered in a glossy white gift box. If you wish to have me ship directly to the recipients, I am happy to enclose a card with whatever message you like.\r\n\r\nBy request, a gift notice can be sent in advance of this commissioned gift. (to you or the recipient)",

"description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE PAGE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY!\r\n\r\n*INSTANT DIGITAL DOWNLOAD* available for you as soon as payment is made... for CUSTOMER to print. ***NO PHYSICAL ITEM WILL BE SHIPPED.***\r\n\r\nI use to sell on E Bay... user name MAC-CAW... store name... THEBEADEDBIRD... & you can see my feedback rating at this link...\r\nhttp://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&userid=mac-caw\r\n\r\nThese are COMPUTER~GENERATED, DIGITAL, ~COUNTED~ cross stitch PATTERNS ONLY.  They are not kits.  You supply your own fabric and floss.\r\n\r\nWITH YOUR PURCHASE YOU WILL RECEIVE...\r\n1. Color picture of the original photograph.\r\n2. A 12 page Black & White Pattern chart with Symbols.\r\n3. A 12 page Color Pattern chart with Symbols.\r\n4. A very helpful ~TIPS~ section.\r\n5. A floss usage amount summary. \r\n6. And a floss chart for DMC, Anchor and JP Coats & Clark, so you can choose your brand of floss.\r\n\r\nThe stitch count is 216 X 163 ... & The finished picture size is 12&quot; W x 9.06&quot; H. when stitched on 18 Count Aida cloth.  But the pattern can be used for any size fabric, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20... etc.  The larger the number count, the smaller the finished piece will be.  The smaller the number count, the larger the finished piece will be.\r\n\r\nThe patterns are quite easy to understand but are recommended for people who already know how to do counted cross stitching. \r\n\r\nNo more squinting trying to read &#39;TINY&#39; symbols.  Easier to read than older, store bought patterns... & loads of fun to stitch!\r\n\r\nThe stitching chart is set ***FOR YOU TO PRINT***... at 8 squares per inch.  All stitches are full Stitches.  No half stitches & no back stitching.\r\n\r\nMy patterns are computer-generated using professional software, designed in the &#39;POINTILLIST&#39; style of art which means that when viewed from several feet away all the colors blend together making the stitched piece look realistic...like the original photo or painting from which it was created.  The amount of colors used allows subtle color changes to create this realistic look. Without it they wouldn&#39;t look anywhere NEAR as good.\r\n\r\nThe second picture is a Virtual image of the STITCHED pattern... (Minus grid lines that mute the colors, of course.)  :D\r\n\r\nThe third picture is Examples of the stitching chart in both B&W & Color... & the Floss Legend, w/symbols for DMC, Anchor and JP Coats & Clark... so you have a choice of floss brands.\r\n\r\nNo returns or refunds due to the nature of this particular item. \r\n***We will not refund money due to the ad *NOT* being read entirely or correctly.***\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER...\r\nDue to the limitations & inconsistencies of various display monitors, the colors you see on your screen may not be a totally accurate reproduction of the actual product. Screen images are intended as a guide only and should not be regarded as absolutely correct. \r\n\r\nThis chart has been designed and printed with our best intentions of being without mistakes. However, the possibility of human error, printing mistakes or the variation of individual stitching does exist, and we regret that we cannot be responsible for this.\r\n\r\nThese are electronic PDF files that you have to print out yourself.",

If you have any questions or need any help you can reach me at TheBeadedBird@ymail.com\r\n\r\nPlease be sure and read the &#39;TIPS&#39; section of the PDF *BEFORE* you print it out.  \r\n\r\nALSO... the &#39;Floss Usage Summary Report&#39; is included in the pattern because it tells you how much floss of each color that you need to buy.  The &#39;Floss Legend&#39; with the symbols is what you want to print out... not the &#39;Floss Usage Summary Report&#39;.  The &#39;Floss Legend&#39; is 2 or 3 pages long & starts with the page that has the colorful, beaded bird in the upper right corner.  ALSO... both the stitch count & the finished project size are shown in the upper left corner of that same page.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope you enjoy stitching it.\r\n\r\nShalom...Linda\r\n",

All of my decorations are hand made and are edible unless it says otherwise.  Some items have stamens in them that are non edible or wires inserted for extra support.  Make sure to read a description of an item,  you will find this information there.  \r\nAll of my products are handcrafted, thus no two items may be exactly the same. Each item is given extra attention to detail. There may be subtle color and shape variations in each piece.\r\nif you have any questions that you have not found in the description, you are welcome to contact me and ask any questions you have. \r\n Since the amount of the items in my store is growing it has become difficult for me to keep all of the items in stock all of the time.  That&#39;s why I make most of the items to order. Please, check the item description to make sure if it is available right away or made to order item.  It usually takes me about 10-21 days to make and ship an item.   If you are looking for custom made decorations, please email me  with your request. As custom decorations can take more time, please allow at least 5-8 weeks for creating and delivery.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

The heat transfer images are fragile because of the open weave of the fabric. Treat with care. Spot cleaning is recommended. \r\n*Custom pillow cover order requests are now limited to the digitally printed images featured in this listing as the heat transfer pillows are being phased out:  https://www.etsy.com/listing/181848034/free-ship-choose-any-image-from-shop-or?ref=shop_home_feat_2\r\n*Convo me if you would like to purchase a pillow insert.

"description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE PAGE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY!\r\n\r\n*INSTANT DIGITAL DOWNLOAD* available for you as soon as payment is made... for CUSTOMER to print. ***NO PHYSICAL ITEM WILL BE SHIPPED.***\r\n\r\nI use to sell on E Bay... user name MAC-CAW... store name... THEBEADEDBIRD... & you can see my feedback rating at this link...\r\nhttp://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&userid=mac-caw\r\n\r\nThese are COMPUTER~GENERATED, DIGITAL, ~COUNTED~ cross stitch PATTERNS ONLY.  They are not kits.  You supply your own fabric and floss.\r\n\r\nWITH YOUR PURCHASE YOU WILL RECEIVE...\r\n1. Color picture of the original photograph.\r\n2. A 12 page Black & White Pattern chart with Symbols.\r\n3. A 12 page Color Pattern chart with Symbols.\r\n4. A very helpful ~TIPS~ section.\r\n5. A floss usage amount summary. \r\n6. And a floss chart for DMC, Anchor and JP Coats & Clark, so you can choose your brand of floss.\r\n\r\nThe stitch count is 216 X 185 ... & The finished picture size is 12&quot; W x 10.28&quot; H. when stitched on 18 Count Aida cloth.  But the pattern can be used for any size fabric, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20... etc.  The larger the number count, the smaller the finished piece will be.  The smaller the number count, the larger the finished piece will be.\r\n\r\nThe patterns are quite easy to understand but are recommended for people who already know how to do counted cross stitching. \r\n\r\nNo more squinting trying to read &#39;TINY&#39; symbols.  Easier to read than older, store bought patterns... & loads of fun to stitch!\r\n\r\nThe stitching chart is set ***FOR YOU TO PRINT***... at 8 squares per inch.  All stitches are full Stitches.  No half stitches & no back stitching.\r\n\r\nMy patterns are computer-generated using professional software, designed in the &#39;POINTILLIST&#39; style of art which means that when viewed from several feet away all the colors blend together making the stitched piece look realistic...like the original photo or painting from which it was created.  The amount of colors used allows subtle color changes to create this realistic look. Without it they wouldn&#39;t look anywhere NEAR as good.\r\n\r\nThe second picture is a Virtual image of the STITCHED pattern... (Minus grid lines that mute the colors, of course.)  :D\r\n\r\nThe third picture is Examples of the stitching chart in both B&W & Color... & the Floss Legend, w/symbols for DMC, Anchor and JP Coats & Clark... so you have a choice of floss brands.\r\n\r\nNo returns or refunds due to the nature of this particular item. \r\n***We will not refund money due to the ad *NOT* being read entirely or correctly.***\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER...\r\nDue to the limitations & inconsistencies of various display monitors, the colors you see on your screen may not be a totally accurate reproduction of the actual product. Screen images are intended as a guide only and should not be regarded as absolutely correct. \r\n\r\nThis chart has been designed and printed with our best intentions of being without mistakes. However, the possibility of human error, printing mistakes or the variation of individual stitching does exist, and we regret that we cannot be responsible for this.\r\n\r\nThese are electronic PDF files that you have to print out yourself.",
